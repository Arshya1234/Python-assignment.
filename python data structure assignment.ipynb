    "2.Can you explain a real-world scenario where using a stack would be a more practical choice than a list for data storage and retrieval?\n",

    "1.Back functionality: A stack follows the last in, first out(LIFO) principle. when the user visits a new page, you can push that page onto the stack. when they click \"back\", you pop the top page from the stack, which corresponds to previous page you visited.\n",

    "2. Effecient navgation: Stacks are efficient for this task because you need only to access the most recent page(the top of the stack) when the user goes back.\n",

Sets ensure that each element is unique, which can be very useful in various problem-solvins=g scenarios such as removing duplicates,checking for membership, set operations, fastlookups."
